1. How are the iterative and recursive algorithms similar and different
   for the same test cases? Which has more repetition?

Both algorithms run a specific nested loop ~5000 times. Both have similar amounts of repetition especially in their loops, and their comparisons.
The difference is that the iterative algorithm is more memory efficient as it negates the need to create a larger function stack.

2. What is the most executed line in the iterative and recursive algorithms?
   Are they the same?

In iterative mode the most executed line is 107, which is run >15000 times ONLY in the 256 input.
Int recursive mode the most executed line is 215, which is run >6000 times ONLY in the 256 input.
More consistently, in iterative most executed line is 242, the nested for loop, and in
the recursive algorithm it is line 144, also a nested for loop.

3. Are there any parts of the code which are not exercised?

The function printArray is never called.

4. If we were to try to optimize either function, where would be a good place to start?

Setting up the array is taking a long time. This would be an interesting place to start. Trying to reduce the amount of numbers we have to calculate.
