1. Why are all the reported times zero.

The gprof command seems to have a precision of 1/100 for time. Since the program runs in less than
0.0009s, the time rounds out to 0.00.

TLDR: Lack of precision

2. Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?

factors_rec is a recursive function. This means it is EXPECTED to call itself multiple times.
On the otherhand factors_itr uses an iterative approach so it doesn't need to be called
multiple time, and it does not recursively call itself.

3. Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls?
   What about the number of prime factors each number produces?

There is no obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls.
Ex/ i=40 -> calls=2; i=79 -> calls=1; i=240 -> calls=27; i=300 -> calls=16; i=999 -> calls=2; i=4000 -> calls=84
Calls seems to get bigger as i increases, but at the same time random inputs like 999, leave us with only 2 calls.

No obvious mathematical relationship between input and number of prime factors.
Roughly gets bigger as the input gets bigger, but then there literal prime numbers like 79, that only have 1 prime factor.
i=40 -> pF=4; i=79 -> pF=1; i=240 -> pF=6; i=300 -> pF=5; i=999 -> pF=4; i=4000 -> pF=8
