**1.** Describe the differences between Linux and Windows.

- Windows directories start from device roots e.g. C:, D:, E:, while linux
starts at a singular '/' start point and everything else is mounted somewhere
on the system (drives show up in /mnt or /mount, or other directories depending on distribution)

- File names are case-insensitive on Windows (this means that transferring code
from a windows machine to a UNIX based machine is sometimes a hassle)

- Linux uses the forward slash to separate directories, Windows uses the
backslash (makes typing directories into command line arguments or into strings
within code is annoying as the backslash has to be escaped)

**2.** How many sign boards did you see on your way to Paradise?

- I saw 3 sign boards.
